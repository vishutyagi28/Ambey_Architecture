            <h3> Modern House</h3>
            <p>A modern house is a style of architecture and design that emphasizes clean lines, open spaces, and a minimalist aesthetic. Originating in the early to mid-20th century, modern houses are characterized by functional layouts, large windows, flat or low-pitched roofs, and an integration of natural materials like wood, stone, and concrete. The design focuses on creating a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor spaces, often with expansive glass walls to bring in natural light and offer unobstructed views. Interiors typically feature open floor plans with interconnected living spaces, eliminating unnecessary walls to enhance the feeling of spaciousness. The color palette tends to be neutral, with earthy tones and simple, unadorned surfaces. Modern homes also prioritize sustainability and efficiency, incorporating eco-friendly materials and advanced technologies such as smart home systems and energy-efficient appliances. Overall, modern houses reflect a philosophy of simplicity, functionality, and innovation, offering a comfortable, stylish, and environmentally conscious living environment.</p>

        <h3> Interior Design</h3>
        <p>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to create a healthier, more aesthetically pleasing, and functional environment for those who use the space. It involves a deep understanding of architecture, furniture, color, texture, lighting, and spatial planning, as well as the psychology of how people interact with their surroundings. Interior designers work to balance form and function, selecting materials, furnishings, and decor that not only reflect a client's personal style but also meet their practical needs. This process includes everything from choosing paint colors and fabrics to arranging furniture and optimizing layouts. In addition to beauty and comfort, interior design also considers factors like safety, accessibility, and energy efficiency. Whether in homes, offices, or public spaces, interior design aims to create an environment that enhances the well-being, mood, and productivity of its occupants.</p>

    <h3>Architectural Design</h3>
    <p>Architectural design is the process of planning, designing, and creating the structure and layout of buildings or other physical environments. It combines both aesthetic and functional elements to ensure that a building is not only visually appealing but also safe, efficient, and sustainable. Architectural design involves a variety of considerations, including site analysis, building codes, structural integrity, materials, environmental impact, and the needs of the occupants. Architects use sketches, blueprints, and 3D models to translate concepts into detailed plans, often collaborating with engineers, interior designers, and other specialists to address technical and practical challenges. The goal of architectural design is to create spaces that are both livable and meaningful, reflecting cultural, social, and environmental values while meeting the intended purpose of the structure. Whether for homes, commercial buildings, or public spaces, architectural design plays a crucial role in shaping our built environment and influencing the way we experience and interact with the spaces around us.

    <h3>Blueprint</h3>
    <p>A blueprint is a detailed technical drawing or plan that represents the architectural design of a building or structure. It is often a scaled representation of the final design, showing various elements such as:
<ul>
      <li>Floor plans:</li>   These illustrate the layout of rooms, corridors, doors, windows, and other features on each floor of the building.
       <li>Elevations:</li>  Side views of the building that show the exterior appearance and how the building will look from different angles.
      <li> Sections:</li>Vertical cuts through the building that show the internal structure, including floor heights, ceiling heights, and how different levels of the building interact.
       <li> Details:</li> Specifics of construction elements, like windows, doors, stairs, or structural elements (beams, columns), often presented in a larger scale to show precise dimensions and materials.
        Blueprints were traditionally printed on blue paper with white lines (hence the name), but now the term is often used to refer to any architectural plan or drawing, regardless of the medium.
